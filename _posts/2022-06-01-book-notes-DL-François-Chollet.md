- "AI can be described as the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans."

- "The central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to *meaningfully transform* data: in other words, to learn useful *representations* of the input data at hand--representations that get us closer to the expected output."  
  - e.g., a CNN transforms pixels into embeddings suitable for classification. 
  - e.g., convert some coordinates from Cartesian to Angular
  
- "These are the two essential characteristics of how deep learning learns from data: *the incremental, layer-by-layer way in which increasingly complex representations are developed*, and the fact that *these intermediate incremental representations are learned jointly*, each layer being updated to follow both the representational needs of the layer above and the needs of the layer below." (**1.2.6 What makes deep learning different**)
  - these enable deep learning to *easily* learn complex features *without feature engineering*, as opposed to shallow learning such as SVM.
