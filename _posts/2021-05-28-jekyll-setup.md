It seems appropriate to dedicate my 1st post to setting up Jekyll for blogging. First I will explain why Jekyll (and Github), then some pointers.

### Why Jekyll
I have a few requirements for my technical blogs.
- Free
- Markdown friendly
- Does not rely on any servers

### How to set up
Mostly I leveraged [jekyll minimal mistakes remote theme][jekyll-mm] after many failures tyring to follow the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] from scratch. This [Github resource][github-page] is also worth reading.

[jekyll-mm]: https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter
[jekyll-docs]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home
[github-page]: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll
